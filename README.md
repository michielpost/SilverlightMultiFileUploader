*NEW*
Improved layout and design
Removed WCF Service. HttpHandler is default
Advantage of the HttpHandler: a lot faster, less requests to the webserver, better for high performance scenarios.

*Single File Upload*
Special version included for SINGLE file upload scenario's. Allows you to only upload 1 file,

*Lite version*
The Lite version of the Silverlight Multi File Uploader is only 1 button. With the button you can select files from your local disk.
All the other functionality can be used through custom JavaScript calls. This way you can totally integrate the control in your existing website.
Example of all JavaScript calls included.

*SharePoint Integration*
Easy SharePoint integration. A WebPart and HttpHandler that work with SharePoint are available as a seperate download.

*PHP script included*
There's a PHP script included. Now you're able to use the Silverlight Multi File Uploader on Apache server using PHP.

*JavaScript*
The Silverlight Multi File Uploader can be controlled using JavaScript. It has full JavaScript support. It's possible to use JavaScript for almost all of the functions in the Silverlight Multi File Uploader. There's an example for all the JavaScript options included. See the screenshot of the JavaScript only implementation below.
